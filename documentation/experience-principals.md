# Experience & Design Principles

## Introduction

These principles were created by the frog design team to support the orchestration and execution of the experience across all Circuit touchpoints.
These principles have been used to guide decisions and evaluate design solutions, to create a coherent and Circuit-specific user experience.

### Circuit tagline

Circuit makes your team*work* better.
