# Experience & Design Principles

## Introduction

These principles were created by the frog design team to support the orchestration and execution of the experience across all Circuit touchpoints.
These principles have been used to guide decisions and evaluate design solutions, to create a coherent and Circuit-specific user experience.

### Circuit tagline

Circuit makes your team*work* better.

## Experience principles
The Experience Principles capture the essential qualities of the long-term experience that Circuit delivers to customers and users.

**HOW:** They influence, guide and inspire the design of all touchpoints by bringing together rational and emotional drivers to provide a clear and focused vision for the organization to align around.

**WHY:** They help teams better understand the qualities—and not just the features—that will ensure that their products and service exceed customer expectations over time.

### Enhance my conversations

Circuit is all about the best conversations people can ever have. The content of conversations is beautifully rendered, vibrant and rich. People are always kept in the flow of the conversation, while changing participants, channels, services or devices. Circuit helps people to get to know each other, and to discover new people for new and interesting conversations.

### Enrich my work

Circuit makes it easy to start, find and continue private and public conversations. From the first use, to call routing, to setting up multiparticipant conference calls, or opening up a conversation to the whole company, Circuit removes complex procedures and tailors complex tasks to the human mind. But enriching work is not only about doing more, Circuit helps to focus and get things done, keeps track of everything and provides insights to move conversations and business forward.

### Assure me

When sharing information and data, knowing who has access to it is vital. Circuit always reassures people of the security of the system and clearly communicates who will receive and have access to information. By assuring people of the integrity of the system, Circuit helps to share information more freely in the organization.

## Design principles

These design principles were developed by the frog design team to keep users’ best interests in mind and to translate the Experience Principles into a tangible outcome. Consider them as you apply your own creativity and design thinking. Deviate with purpose.

### Enhance my conversations

#### Keep me in the flow of my conversation
In One to One conversations flow is based on the exclusive conversation between two participants that never change. In a conversation with several participants flow is based on the context of the conversation. Participants can change, but the conversation goes on. Circuit does not break people out of the flow of a group conversation because participants change.

#### Delight me with vibrant conversations
Conversations should be rich with large previews and small, delightful details.

#### Surprise me
Circuit is a rich and deep application which the user can grow into. New functionality and little details can be discovered over time, keeping the experience always interesting and the users engaged.

#### Get to know me
Circuit learns the user’s preferences over time. Rather than asking them to make the same choices over and over, place previous choices within easy reach.

### Enrich my work

#### Let me continue the same conversations

Conversations are the same (unique) when participants are consistent throughout the whole conversation. Circuit helps the user to continue these conversation when starting a new conversation with the same participants. Circuit never merges conversations which are not the same.

#### If it looks the same, it should behave the same
Help users understand functional differences by making them visually distinct rather than subtle. Avoid elements that look similar but act differently on the same input.

#### Keep me focused
If possible keep the user in the current view, play, show, and preview inline. Don’t jump to new windows for a user’s active task, whether it is an active call, conversation, or conference.

#### Only interrupt me if it’s important
Like a good personal assistant, shield people from unimportant minutiae. People want to stay focused, and unless it’s critical and time-sensitive, an interruption can be taxing and frustrating.

#### Don’t distract me
People want to be as efficient as possible. Functional areas should be reduced and clean. Animations, transitions, and sounds should be subtle, quick and elegant. Use short phrases with simple words. People are likely to skip sentences if they’re long.

### Assure me

#### Enable me to share but protect my privacy
Circuit is about conversations to share and capture knowledge, so sharing is paramount. By default the conversation history in groups is shared to keep people in the flow of the conversation, but Circuit makes it easy and helps the user to start a new group conversation if the history should not be shared. Circuit allows users to make their group conversations public (accessible to the whole company), but offers options to keep public conversations exclusive.

#### Enable me I should always know what I am broadcasting and to whom to share but protect my privacy
Information in a work environment can be sensitive and users need to be clearly notified when they are broadcasting to colleagues. Circuit lets the user know which applications are shared for screen sharing, when he is sharing video, and when other users are able to hear or see her comments.

#### It’s not my fault
Be gentle in how you prompt people to make corrections. They want to feel smart when they use Circuit. If something goes wrong, give clear recovery instructions but spare them the technical details. If you can fix it behind the scenes, even better.

#### Only show what I need when I need it
People get overwhelmed when they see too much at once. Break tasks and information into small, digestible chunks. Hide options that aren’t essential at the moment, and teach people as they go and give feedback on actions in a subtle way.
