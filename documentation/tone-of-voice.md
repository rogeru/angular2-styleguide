# Tone of Voice

## Overview

Just like people, strong brands have a unique personality that is reflected through word choice, rhythm, structure and style. Verbal tone helps to define who we are and how we are perceived. It expresses our values and connects us with our audiences. It helps define us.

By demonstrating a cohesive and consistent brand voice, we:

* Build a relationship with our business customers
* Reinforce our brand positioning
* Differentiate Unify in a competitive category

These guidelines explain the characteristics of the Circuit brand voice— how Circuit speaks, if you will. If you need clarification or help in adjusting these principles to meet your specific needs, contact one of the brand communications specialists below.

## What is Circuit’s tone of voice

Circuit’s tone of voice informs how we speak to our users, which shapes their perceptions of us, giving them a feeling for who we are.

* It should be human, confident, professional, direct and optimistic.
* It is personal and attending.
* It is not arrogant or negative.
* It is not filled with jargon or jokes.
* Copy should be brisk and informative, pragmatic but never dull.

## Brand vs. company tone of voice

This page talks about the tone of voice for Circuit, not Unify. Circuit—as a product of Unify—certainly respects the tone of Unify, but there are a few important differences between the tone of the brand (Circuit) and the tone of the company (Unify):

* A company might have several brands, each with its own tone of voice.
* Each brand’s tone of voice might be completely different from other brands belonging to the same company, or from the company’s corporate tone (consider the contrast between a Walt Disney microsite and its corporate content).
* The audiences for brand and corporate content might be utterly different, with no overlap whatsoever—or they might be aimed at the same audience at different times, or in different situations.
* An individual brand’s tone of voice is likely to evolve much more quickly than a corporate tone, perhaps to stay in line with changing customer expectations, while corporate tone of voice is more monolithic, expressing the unchanging values or corporate culture of the organization.

## Circuit positioning

When we develop communications for Circuit, it is important to start with a clear understanding of our positioning (where we fit in the market), our value proposition, and our key messages. We also want to keep in mind our brand essence, attributes and promise, as those need to come through in our tone and word choices.

### Positioning
You are anywhere. Circuit is you. Circuit brings us together for the way we really work.

### Product description
Circuit brings video, voice, messaging, and screen and file sharing into a single view. It’s natural conversations. It’s moments of insight. It’s all of us, working together.

### Value proposition

Make your teamwork better.

### Key messages

We move. Circuit travels with us, freeing us to work where we
want, when we want and how we want.

* **We discover.** Circuit offers context, finding what we need, what we discussed, what we shared and what we missed.
* **We create.** Circuit inspires, sparking conversation and bringing minds together to invent, build and solve.
* **We share.** Circuit unites, keeping us connected and on top of what really matters.

### Brance essence

Circuit is freedom.

### Brand attributes

Connected | Trustworthy | Expert | Transformative | Inspiring | Vibrant

Together, these descriptors are the “heart and soul” of Circuit: what it is,
how it behaves, what it “feels” like, what it promises. At the core, Circuit is
free, human, connected and natural. What needs to come through in every
communication? **Circuit is you.**

## Tone of voice principles

Circuit’s Design Principles help us understand more about the tone of voice:

### Keep it brief.

Use short phrases with simple words. Tell the user only what is necessary.
People are likely to skip sentences if the sentence is long.

### Interrupt me only if it’s important.

Like a good personal assistant, shield people from unimportant minutiae. People want to stay focused, and unless it’s critical and time-sensitive, an interruption can be taxing and frustrating.

### It’s not my fault.

Be gentle in how you prompt people to make corrections. They want to feel smart when they use Circuit. If something goes wrong, give clear recovery instructions, but spare them the technical details. If you can fix it behind the scenes, even better.

## Who is Circuit?

**Circuit is an approachable, simple, calm and humble enabler/servant.** <br>
It’s all about you: navigation and functions are dialed back to place the user’s content front and center. The UI should be self-explanatory without having to tell the user. If no hint text is needed, there is no hint text. Keep it simple.

**Circuit is not a person or thing.** <br>
It’s not Circuit doing something—things happen because the user initiated them. Things fail because there is a failure, not because Circuit failed. Circuit would not tell the user: “I am sending a message” or “Please wait while I am doing x” or “Sorry, it seems I/we have an issue with the server.” Instead, the text would say: “Message pending/delivered” or “Please wait while x is happening” or “The server is not responding. Please try later, or contact your administrator.”

**Circuit is friendly, but not personal.** <br>
Labels, explanation texts and messages are written in a human, understandable way (no tech vocabulary), but they are not funny and they do not use verbiage. The default hint text for the status message could be: “Your status message”—straightforward and not trying to be clever.

**Circuit can talk to the user.** <br>
The user is addressed in a formal way, but without verbiage (e.g., “Dear Sir or Madam”). In some cases, the name of the user can be used to address him or her directly, but then the full name (first and last name) needs to be used. It’s about respect.

**Circuit is sophisticated, but holds back.** <br>
The welcome message on the login screen may vary, based on the time of day, for example. The notification for a new message may be issued first on the last device used, but Circuit doesn’t try to predict behavior based on patterns.

**Circuit learns and helps, but does not patronize.** <br>
Circuit may ask “Did you mean…” or “Are you looking for…” if there are no results for a search. But Circuit does not correct the search term automatically.

## Additional rules

* Do not apologize when something goes wrong.
* Talk positively rather than negatively.
* Guide the user on what he should do, not what he shouldn’t do.
* Put important information first.
* Say “you, your, yours” instead of “me, I, my, mine.”
* Respect cultural patterns and behaviors; work with native people to do translations and localization:
* For example, in Japan, “Please” is a mandatory form of politeness.
* Use “1,2,3,4” instead of “one, two, three, four.”
* Be polite, but don’t overdo it: Say “please,” but don’t wrap every sentence in false politeness:
* Don’t: “Sorry, there is no connection right now. Would you please be so kind to try again?”
* Give the user understandable feedback about why something happens:
* Do: “The message could not be sent, because there is no internet connection.”
* Don’t: “No connection to the internet. The XYZ server returns unknown proxy settings.”
* Give the user suggestions about how to solve a problem, but only when the reasons are known and the solution is easy for the user:
* Don’t: “No connection to the internet. It could be that your proxy settings are unknown to the server.”
* When formatting text, use sentence-style capitalization for all UI strings (including button labels, control labels, etc.) and capitalize names.
* Don’t: “WARNING. The Password is wrong.”
* Use a period after sentences or phrases; for example, in a list, label or notification.
* Do not use exclamation marks to emphasize importance.
* Don’t: “The password you have entered is wrong!”
* Do not use an ampersand (“&”) in place of the word “and.”

## Writing for a global audience

When writing for a global audience, we start with American English, but we don’t use language that is familiar or relevant only to a particular local audience. Many references and phrases may have a different meaning—or no meaning at all—in another culture.

These principles will help us avoid confusion when writing for a global readership.

**Avoid colloquial expressions.** <br>
Avoid terms such as “push the envelope,” “leading edge” or “fly-by-night.” Avoid sports metaphors, such as “level playing field” or “drop the ball.”

**Avoid seasonal references.** <br>
Depending on the hemisphere, one country’s winter is another’s summer. It is better to specify the month.

**Don’t make vague country references.** <br>
“We are the most flexible enterprise communications specialist in the country” doesn’t clearly define the country referenced. It is better to state the specific country or region.

**Be specific about the location.** <br>
Well-known localities (for example, Tokyo, London, Sydney) do not require a state, province or country reference to identify them; but, in most cases, it is better to be specific to avoid confusion (for example, London, Ontario).

**Be careful when making cultural references.** <br>
Don’t assume a global audience will understand names or phrases derived from a country’s culture; for example, “ivory tower” or “low-hanging fruit.”

**Avoid popular or clichéd business terms.** <br>
Many terms are simply overused and lack precise meaning (for example, “core competencies,” “best practice,” “leveraging”). Other terms, such as “rightsizing,” “downsizing” or “brainstorming session,” should not be used unless explaining them at least once.

**Avoid superlatives** <br>
Some descriptions don’t sound impressive, just overblown (for example, “unsurpassed,” “unparalleled,” “spectacular”). Use more understated, less sensational words (for example, “effective,” “impactful,” “exceptional”).
